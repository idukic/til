- __x == y__, __x != y__ (equal, not equal)
- __x & y__ (logical AND), __x && y__ (conditional AND - evaluates y only if x is true)
- __x | y__ (logical OR), __x || y__ (conditional OR - evaluates y only if x is false)
- __X ?? y__ (Null coalescing - evaluates to y if x is null, to x otherwise)
- __x ? y : z__ (conditional - Evaluates y if x is true, z if x is false)
